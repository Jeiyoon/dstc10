User: What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet","System: well, it's like a cage match of tennis. The main difference is that both players play in the same 'court' and the ball is smashed against a wall instead of passing it over a net into the opponent's court.
