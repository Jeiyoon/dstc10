 yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten . 
 right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious 
 that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ?

 hi , yes i do . do you like music ? 
 very much , i was so excited to learn that "" /hybrid theory""from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! ! 
 did you ever have any cassette tapes ? 
 yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's 
 what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones . 
 i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool ! 
 i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums . 
 that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! ! 
 spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ? 
 i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! ! 
 yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented . 
 yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages ! 
 batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat . 
 that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack !

 that 's got ta be expensive ! what 's the best place in chicago ? where should i go when i visit ? 
 i like the natural history museum and millennium park . lou malnati 's has amazing pizza . it is very expensive to travel in japan . it costs more than $ 300 to travel across the country . 
 that 's a lot . i can not imagine having to pay that in tolls . i do like lou 's pizza . have you been to wrigley field ? i should ask first if you are a baseball fan ... 
 i have not . we did stop outside of soldier field but did n't get to go in . did you know that iceland has no public rail service ? 
 that 's odd . soldier field is just ok . the shedd is really good though . where else , besides chicago do you like going ? 
 i enjoyed the mountains of tennessee . they are beautiful . we got a cabin with an amazing view . i would go to a lot more places if you could get there faster . the dutch are working on that . they are creating a commuter bus that goes 160 mph . that would be great . 
 can you imagine the movie speed on that bus ! ! ! ! holy smokes !

"hey are you aware of banned books week ? 
 i did n't know it was a thing because i did n't realize that there are any books that are banned . what do you know about it ? 
 i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood 
 are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status 
 yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ? 
 not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books 
 well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me 
 true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years
